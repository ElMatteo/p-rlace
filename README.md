The goal is to re create a r/place in our own way.
[You can see an example by clicking here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/)

_Users will be able to place a pixel on a web page every minute._

The pixel can be :
  * Blue
  * White
  * Yellow
  * Gray
  * Black
  * etc...

_**This page will be on a server then users can battle to create the biggest art on the page.**_

## How to run ? ##
```bash
npm run start
```
_**or**_
```bash
npm start
```
